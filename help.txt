Usage: runup [--model=paths] [build]

If "build" is specified, a release build will be made, otherwise, Runup starts in development mode.

Options:

--model, -m:        Comma (",") separated list of paths to model files (default: "?./project").
                    If a path starts with "." or "..", it's resolved relative to CWD.
                    Otherwise it's resolved using the Node require mechanism
                    (meaning it could point to any Node module).
                    If a path starts with "?" it's considered optional and the process won't fail if it doesn't exist.

--verbose, -v:      Print additional info.

--help, -h:         You're reading it.
